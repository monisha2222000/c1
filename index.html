<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
<div class="con1">
<ol>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. </li>
    <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
    <li> <span class="con2">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="con3">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <span class="con4"><li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li></span>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
<div class="con5">
<ul >
    <li>Inline- by using the style attribute</li>
    <li>internal- by using a style elementin in the head section</li>
    <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. <span class="con6">However , in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple element. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript. </p>
<p>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. 
</p>
<p>There is  a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
